								<b>Background</b>
								<br>Hello! I am an NHFP Einstein Fellow at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and affiliated with the NSF-Simons AI Institute for the Sky (SkAI) in Chicago.
								My research focuses on a range of transients resulting from accretion onto supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.
								I'm especially interested in multi-wavelength follow-up of optically-selected transient events.
								<br>
								<br>I was born and raised in Maryland and did my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
								I then moved to the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, where I received my PhD in April 2025. I recently moved to Illinois to start my Einstein Fellowship. 
								In addition to astronomy, I enjoy musicals, sports, and spending time with my cat Cookie!

								<b>Research Interests</b>
								<br>My primary research interests lie in observational astrophysics, with a particular focus on transient astronomy, including tidal disruption events, 
								active galactic nucleus flares, active galactic nucleus variability, and transient host galaxies. I am also interested in a number of other time-domain projects
								such as stellar flares.

								<b>Tidal Disruption Events</b>
								<br>A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star is ripped apart by a supermassive black hole.
								Once a theoretical concept, we are now discovered tens of new TDEs per year thanks to the growth of transient sky surveys
								like the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), 
							        the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).
								<br>
								<br>TDEs are promising probes of black holes, as information on properties like black hole mass and spin are imprinted on TDE observables.
								Nevertheless, there are still large gaps in our understanding of the physics behind TDE emission. I am interested in better understanding 
								the physics behind TDEs both through detailed studies of nearby events and by building robust samples with which we can search for correlations.

							<p>
								<b>Active Galactic Nucleus Variability</b>
								<br>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the actively accreting supermassive black holes at the centers of roughly 10% of galaxies
								in the local universe. Normally, they vary in a stochastic manner, but sometimes they exhibit large flares. In many cases these 
								photometric flares are accompanied by changes in their optical spectra. It remains unclear how these flares originate, 
								but they nevertheless represent a unique probe of extreme accretion environments.

								<b>Ambiguous Nuclear Transients</b>
								<br>Some transients do not look like either AGN flares or TDEs. We've nicknamed such transients ambiguous nuclear transients, or ANTs.
								These events seem to share some characteristics of TDEs (similar UV/optical evolution, blue optical spectra) but also have similarities
								to AGNs (power-law X-ray emission, massive black holes). One possibility is that many ANTs are simply transients like TDEs or supernovae 
								occurring in an AGN host galaxy. However, the study of ANTs is still in the early stages, and the universe continues to surprise us with
								new objects that are increasingly hard to reconcile with a single physical model.

							<h2 class="major">Mentoring</h2>
							<p>
								I am passionate about mentoring students, and have been lucky to co-mentor several excellent research experience for undergraduates (REU)
								students and a first-year UH student with my PhD advisor, Ben Shappee. Below are short descriptions of the various projects I've helped advise.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Jesse Zeldes (UH REU) - Superflaring M-dwarfs with K2 and TESS</b>
								<br>Jesse studied low-mass stars that were observed to undergo a very energetic flare in ASAS-SN data.
								Jesse used high-cadence and high-precision <a href=https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/k2/ target="_blank">K2</a>
								and <a href=https://tess.mit.edu/ target="_blank">TESS</a> data to compare the flare-frequency distributions (i.e. how often
								a flare of a given energy occurs) to broader samples. See Jesse's paper <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210904501Z/abstract target="_blank">here</a>.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Helena Treiber (UH REU → Princeton grad) - Selecting AGNs From TESS Variability</b>
								<br>Lena developed methods to select active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on their stochastic variability. Lena used 
								<a href=https://tess.mit.edu/ target="_blank">TESS</a> data to search for AGNs, particularly those with low black hole masses.
								She succeeded in finding several new candidate AGNs, and we learned several valuable lessons about using TESS to search for
								variable sources. See Lena's paper <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.525.5795T/abstract target="_blank">here</a>.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Vera Berger (UH REU → MIT grad) - Stellar Flares with GALEX</b>
								<br>Vera analyzed the UV emission from stellar flares. Vera used <a href=http://www.galex.caltech.edu/ target="_blank">GALEX</a>
								data to search for and characterize flares on a sample of nearby stars, finding that the typically assumed flare temperatures of 9000 - 10,000 K are underestimated.
								See Vera's paper <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.532.4436B/abstract target="_blank">here</a> and a press release based on her work 
								<a href=https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/astronomers-uncover-risks-to-planets-that-could-host-life target="_blank">here</a>.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Michael Bolish (UH REU) - AGN Variability with ASAS-SN</b>
								<br>Michael's project focused on studying the variability properties of well-measured AGNs using ASAS-SN survey data.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Ashley Tarrant (UH REU → CU grad in Atmospheric Sciences) - AGN Variability with ASAS-SN</b>
								<br>Ashley is studying the variability properties of well-measured AGNs using ASAS-SN survey data. She is currently
								using damped-random walk modeling to understand the correlation between the variability timescale of an AGN and its central 
								supermassive black hole mass. See Ashley's paper 
								<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250112444T/abstract target="_blank">here</a>.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Willem Hoogendam (UH grad) - Tidal Disruption Events</b>
								<br>Willem led the discovery paper on the closest TDE to date, ASASSN-23bd. ASASSN-23bd occurred in a galaxy that hosts an AGN, atypical for TDEs, and providing
								a window into the interplay between tidal debris and the AGN disk. ASASSN-23bd is also one of the least luminous and fastest declining TDEs yet observed, with the 
								broader class of faint and fast TDEs being promising probes of intermediate mass black holes. See Willems's paper 
								<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.530.4501H/abstract target="_blank">here</a> and a press release based on his work 
								<a href=https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2024/03/05/star-ripped-apart-by-black-hole/ target="_blank">here</a>.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Athena Engholm (UH undergrad → UIUC grad) - Coronal Line Emitters</b>
								<br>Athena is studying an unusual nuclear transient discovered by the ATLAS survey, which shows high ionization (>100 eV) coronal lines
								in its optical spectra.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Allison Blum (UH REU → UH grad) - Ambiguous Nuclear Transients</b>
								<br>Allison is studying an ambiguous nuclear transient discovered by the ASAS-SN survey, with an unusual host galaxy and properties that
								blur the lines between typical TDEs and AGN flares.

							<h2 class="major">Outreach and Service</h2>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach</b>
								<br>As a graduate student, I participated in many outreach events throughout the state of Hawaii.
								This included events like the IfA Open House, as well as IfA booths at many larger events 
								such as the Honolulu Children and Youth Day and the Hawaii Geek Meet.
								<br>
								<br>I was fortunate to participate in the <a href=https://maunakeascholars.com/ target="_blank">Maunakea Scholars</a>
								program as a mentor since joining the IfA. In this program, I worked with high school students at
								Kapolei High School to develop short research projects in astronomy. After helping the students write proposals,
								they competed for time on Hawaii-based telescopes, with many receiving observing time!
								<br>
								<br>I also mentored for the <a href=https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/outreach/histar-2/ target="_blank">HI STAR</a>
								program, working with a student on Maui to conduct a state science fair project.
								
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Astrobites</b>
								<br>I was an author for Astrobites, as well as serving on several committees within the collaboration. As an Astrobites
								author, I wrote bite-sized summaries of astronomy papers from a wide range of fields. I have also served on the Astrobites education, 
								editorial, and hiring committees. Additionally, I was the Astrobites undergraduate co-chair for two years. As part of this role, I helped
								connect undergrads to write guest posts on Astrobites, helped lead an effort to clean up old guides on the Astrobites website, and 
								helped plan and moderate the first Astrobites webinar.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Departmental Service</b>
								<br>As an IfA graduate student, I have served on several departmental committees as a graduate student representative. These include the colloquial committee, admissions committee,
								 the graduate research oversight group (GROG), the time allocation committee (TAC), and as the graduate representative to the faculty search committee.
