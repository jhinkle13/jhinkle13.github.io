								<b>Background</b>
								<br>Hi all! My name is Alexa Anderson, and I'm a third-year PhD student at the Institute for
								Astronomy at the University of Hawai'i at Mﾄ］oa. Though I was born in Tokyo, Japan, I grew up in
								the town of Kailua, Hawai'i. Later, I moved to New Haven to complete my undergraduate degree in 
								Astrophysics at Yale University. When I'm not doing astronomy, you can probably find me eating some 
								of the great food that Hawai'i has to offer or watching film noir from the 1950s.

								<b>Research Interests</b>
								<br>My primary research interests are protoplanetary disks, as well as star and planet formation. I'm especially
								interested in the demographics of protoplanetary disk populations, in addition to the hot, inner, planet-forming
								regions of disks. In past projects, I've surveyed hundreds of protostars in Perseus and hundreds of protoplanetary
								disks in Serpens, as well as conducted in-depth studies on single objects, like the dipper RECX-11 (EP Cha). I 
								utilize a broad range of wavelength regimes (sub-mm to X-ray) in my studies, and hope to couple together NIR 
								spectroastrometry of disks with ALMA sub-mm observations to probe the physical structures within the inner-disk 
								for my thesis.

								<b>A Multi-Wavelength Investigation of the Dynamic Inner Protoplanetary Disk of EP Cha (RECX-11)</b>
								<br><i>Advised by Dr. Eric Gaidos, IfA</i>
								<br>Young stars display an incredible range of variability. One class of these objects, "dippers," display dimming events on the timescales of 
								hours to days. This dimming is caused by occultation of circumstellar dust obscuring starlight, and can give vital information about the kinematics
								and composition of inner, planet-forming regions of protoplanetary disks. With EP Cha (RECX-11) as a case study, I performed a multi-wavelength
								analysis to learn about inner disk properties of both existing gas and dust. 
								
								<br><br>To understand the gas properties and kinematics, I used Swift XRT data in conjunction with solar corona plasma modeling from XSPEC to estimate the
								gas column density during and outside of occulting events. Comparing the derived column density to TESS light curves taken contemporaneously,
								I determined that the optical dimming and gas column density were correlated. I also calculated accretion rates onto
								EP Cha from LCO NRES spectra, and found that the source is accreting in a manner typical of T-Tauri stars.
								
								<br><br>To understand the dust properties and behavior, I developed an infrared photometry pipeline for use with the Rapid
								Eye Mount Telescope. After constructing J, H, and K-band light curves, I determined that the infrared color variability
								is most likely due to accretion rather than reddening. Last, in conjunction with undergraduate student Lynzee Hoegger,
								we performed chemical modeling to estimate the size of different species of dust grains within EP Cha's inner disk.

								<b><br>Protostellar and Protoplanetary Disk Masses in the Serpens Region</b>
								<br><i>Advised by Dr. Jonathan Williams, IfA</i>
								<p>
									<img src="images/Serpens.png" style="float:right;width: 250px; height: auto;margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px;">
									<br>Planets are formed out of dusty "protoplanetary" disks. Though this is well established, the exact processes that
									influence a planet's formation and evolution are relatively uncertain. Specifically, regions of high stellar density may 
									dynamically truncate or disperse disks. Similarly, massive and hot OB stars may
									induce photoevaporation, changing the lifetime and chemistry of nearby disks. 
									
									<br><br>To differentiate between the effects of 
									clustering and photoevaporation from typical protoplanetary disk evolution, I led a demographic survey of 320 disks in
									Serpens, a star forming region with no massive stars and a high stellar density. Using 1" resolution data of the 1.3 mm
									dust continuum and 12CO isotopologue, my work found that Serpens does not
									differ significantly from other star-forming regions of a similar age, hinting that clustering and photoevaporation may not
									have a strong impact on disk lifetimes and evolution. Additionally, I catalogued fifteen protostellar outflows in 12CO and
									identified a candidate Class 0 source embedded deeper within the Serpens cloud. To see more, visit 
									<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...55A/abstract"> here</a>.

								<b><br>Using Dark Clouds to Understand Distant Galaxies</b>
								<br><i>Advised by Dr. Jens Kauffmann & Dr. Hector Arce, MIT Haystack Observatory & Yale University, NSF REU & STARS II Fellow</i>
								<p>
									<img src="images/IC5146.png" style="float:left;width: 250px; height: auto;margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px;">
									<br>Star formation rates in dark molecular clouds are often related to gas mass above a certain density threshold. However, 
									it is unknown if this relation is universal, especially amongst different gas species between clouds. I analyzed several molecular species across a variety of clouds, 
									focusing on IC5146. My work found that this relation didn't hold for the canonical molecule HCN between clouds or within IC5146, indicating
									that star formation estimates using this relation alone may be more uncertain than their quoted error bars. Additionally, I 
									wrote code to interface with IRSA's IPAC database to retrieve variable-sized cutouts of images from all missions available.

								<b>Mapping Protostellar Outflows in Perseus</b>
								<br><i>Advised by Dr. Hector Arce, Yale University</i>
								<br>I created moment 0 and contour maps from data cubes to identify protostellar outflows and morphologies in several
								different molecular species.

								<b>Satellite Galaxy Evolution in Colorspace</b>
								<br><i>Advised by Dr. Marla Geha, Yale University, Science, Technology, and Research (STARS) Summer Fellow</i>
								<br>I studied
								the evolution of satellite galaxies in the summer of 2017. Using Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis modeling code, I analyzed how
								the colors of satellite galaxies in the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey would change over time. I presented my work
								at the <a href="https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/STARS%20Su17_Final%20Symposium%20Booklet_25Jul2017.pdf">
								STARS Summer Symposium </a>.
